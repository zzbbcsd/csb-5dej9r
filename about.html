            One Piece[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
            Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga
            magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual
            chapters compiled into 103 tankōbon volumes as of August 2022. The
            story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
            gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil
            Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores
            the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D.
            Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to
            become the next King of the Pirates.

            The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a
            festival film produced by Production I.G, and an anime series
            produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in
            1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature
            films, one original video animation and thirteen television
            specials. Several companies have developed various types of
            merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous
            video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language
            release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in
            Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by
            4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America
            in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by
            Funimation in 2007.

            One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art,
            characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is
            ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga
            of all time. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing
            records, including the highest initial print run of any book in
            Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for
            "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a
            single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive
            years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial
            print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10
            years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million
            copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One
            Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year
            in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.

          <br />
          <p>
            As of August 2022, One Piece had over 516.5 million copies in
            circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the
            best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic
            series printed in book volume. It is also one of the
            highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
