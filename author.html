            Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born
            January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the
            series One Piece (1997–present). With more than 516.5 million
            tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is both the
            best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series
            printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling
            fiction authors. The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named
            one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Early Life: Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto,
            Japan. He said that at the age of four he resolved to become a manga
            artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job". His biggest
            influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball. He recalls
            that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV
            animation series titled Vicky the Viking. He submitted a character
            named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman.
            Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later
            return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work Wanted! and won several
            awards, including second place in the coveted Tezuka Award. That got
            him into a job at the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine, where he
            originally worked as assistant manga artist/assistant to Shinobu
            Kaitani's series Suizan Police Gang before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro
            on Jungle King Tar-chan and Mizu no Tomodachi Kappaman,which gave
            him an unexpected influence on his artistic style. At the age of 19,
            he began working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni
            Kenshin, before winning the Hop Step Award for new manga artists.
            Watsuki credits Oda for helping create the character Honjō Kamatari
            who appears in Rurouni Kenshin.
