            One Piece might be the greatest story ever told. It might be the
            Tolkien-tier odyssey of our generation. It might take over your
            life. These are just a few things that I, a One Piece obsessive,
            tell people in order to convince them to read my favourite story.
            Admittedly, I'm not usually an avid reader - I have been told this
            voids my opinions entirely - but nevertheless, every week that goes
            by without a One Piece chapter feels like the longest week of my
            life. All of you need to get in on this suffering with me
            immediately.

            Netflix is producing a live-action adaptation of the One Piece
            story, and for a tale as goofy and absurdist as this, it could go
            disastrously wrong. It needs Hollywood CGI to make the world
            believable, in addition to the silly, stretchy powers of our
            protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy. It could turn out to be the worst
            thing ever, or it could be the new Game of Thrones. Either way, you
            need to start reading One Piece now so you can tell people you liked
            it before it was cool. There’s never been a better time than now to
            start devouring a 1,000+ chapter manga adventure - that’s another
            thing I tell people to make them read it.

            The Pirate King was executed 20 years ago. On the execution stand,
            he told the people of the world to find all of the treasures he'd
            discovered, which he collectively named the One Piece. The king was
            inevitably silenced, but not before inspiring a generation to take
            to the seas. People around the world seeking wealth, fame, power,
            and freedom all set sail to find the One Piece, which was left at
            the end of the Grand Line, a sea that only the Pirate King could
            conquer. One Piece doesn't take place in a single location, rather
            it’s set in a vast world. The story begins in the East Blue, the
            most peaceful of the five seas, and follows Luffy as he attempts to
            recruit a crew to travel with him to the most perilous place on the
            planet, the Grand Line.
